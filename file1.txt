  "Vim is one of a select bunch of tools for which I
  have no substitute.  It is a brilliant piece of
  work!"
                                        (Biju Chacko)

  "Vim is really a fantastic editor.
  It has sooooo many features and more importantly,
  the defaults are so well thought out that you
  really don't have to change anything!!  Words
  cannot express my amazement and gratitude to the
  creators of VIM.  Keep it up. 
                                         (Vikas, USA)
